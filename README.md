# bitcrypt
*A basic binary-ascii cryptor*

A fun little C program to encrypt and decrypt between a string of binary bits and a string of ascii bytes.

## Installation
Clone the repository. Enter the cloned directory. Run `Make`. It's a simple program, so there aren't many options.

## Example screens
    $ ./bitcrypt MAYBE
    01001101 01000001 01011001 01000010 01000101 
    $ ./bitcrypt "01001101 01000001 01011001 01000010 01000101"
    MAYBE

## Backstory a.k.a. Developer motivation
So, one day the developer (D) was having an indecisive moment and went to talk to a good friend (F). Here is how the conversation went...  
D: Should I do this?  
F: maybe.  
D: That doesnt help. I need it in binary dude.  
F: 01101101 01100001 01111001 01100010 01100101  
D: dat a buncha rando bytes?  
F: no...  
And, so, folks, that's the backstory of this little piece of software.
